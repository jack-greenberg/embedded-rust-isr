My name is Jack. I'm a rising senior at [Olin College of Engineering] studying
__electrical and computer engineering__. I work mostly in the embedded systems
space, but am familiar with all layers of the stack: from web development to
bare metal.

At Olin I am a member of the Formula SAE team [Olin Electric Motorsports]
currently advising the electrical team as we build our Mark 6 vehicle.
Previously on the team, I wrote a brand-new CAN stack, as well as SPI, UART, and
GPIO drivers. I also wrote a [CAN bootloader] that allows us to update the
firmware on any of our boards just using CAN.

I recently finished my second internship at Apple in the Special Projects Group.
I am under a strict NDA, but can say that I was an embedded software controls
engineer building a product that has not reached the market. I worked closely
with electrical, mechanical, and controls engineers to develop integrated
engineering systems[^1], and developed firmware drivers for interfacing with
sensors and other hardware peripherals.

[^1]: Vague, I know. Sorry :disappointed:

I've also done some work with [Indico](https://indico.io) as a backend software
engineer on some optimizations for their microservices networking
infrastructure.  I got my start with computers as a web developer at [Yay
Brigade](https://yaybrigade.com), a design studio based in downtown Los Angeles.

These days, I am doing a lot of cooking, learning Rust and ASL
:love_you_gesture:, and taking classes at Olin.
