I've been thinking about starting a blog for a while now.

I've been talking to friends and family for a while now about wanting to start a
blog. Somewhere to put the things I am learning, the things I find interesting,

So this is a blog. There won't be any fixed frequency to the posts, but
hopefully a roughly bi-weekly cadence. I'd like to talk about music, science,
technology, cooking, ASL, and grief.
