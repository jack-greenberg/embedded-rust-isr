Online shopping A few months ago, I was browsing Adafruit and came across a cute looking dev board called the WeAct Studio STM32H750 Development Board. It has
an LCD screen, a camera, an SD card slot, a USB-C connector, and an STM32H750VB microcontroller. This seemed like a great candidate to get started using embedded Rust, especially because I was hoping to be able to use it as a platform to play around with Hubris.</description></item><item><title>Embedded Rust From Embedded C: Peripherals</title><link>https://blog.jackgreenberg.co/posts/embedded-rust-from-embedded-c/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 17:09:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.jackgreenberg.co/posts/embedded-rust-from-embedded-c/</guid><description>As an embedded C developer, I have become entrenched in the ways of the language. Things like using structs to access registers or opaque pointers for passing data around1. Rust provides a whole new memory model that makes writing any program safer at no extra cost. In the next few posts we&amp;rsquo;ll explore some of the patterns that make embedded Rust special and compare them to how things are done in C.</description></item></channel></rss>
